# pin_code_app

A Flutter app that creates a PIN code for a user.

## PIN code creation

The app should meet the following requirements:

PIN code has 4 digits
Each digits is entered in a dedicated field and obfuscated after it has been entered
Once all digits have been entered, the user is requested to re-enter the same PIN
If PIN codes match, user is shown a message that PIN codes match and a button to close the app
If PIN codes do not match, message is shown to the user and app is closed automatically
Some state management should be done with a state management package such as BLoC or Riverpod
